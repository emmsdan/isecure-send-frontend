# iSecure-send-api

I woke up one morning and decided to do "**_A simple end-to-end encrypted file sending system_**". That's why we have this project.

It has just three main feature:

- upload files and secure
- control file access/download
  - download files a number of times.
  - files can't be downloaded after a particular time
- only the person sent to can access/download it.

but you can contribute to it by just raising a PR.
